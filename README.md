# PyPRF
<img src="logo/logo.png" width=200 align="right" />

A free & open source *python package* for *population receptive field (pRF) analysis*. With this package you can present visual stimuli for a retinotopic mapping fMRI experiment, and perform a pRF analysis on the fMRI data.

### 1. Stimulus presentation
Presents visual stimuli for retinotopic mapping experiments. The stimuli consist of bars at different locations and orientations, filled with flickering black and white checkerboards. It is important that the participant fixates throughout the experiment. Therefore, there is a central fixation task. The fixation dot occasionally changes its colour, and the task is to press a button (number `1`) in response. At the end of the presentation, the participant's hit rate is provided as feedback.

### 2. Data analysis  
Analysis tools for fMRI data from retinotopic mapping experiment. A pRF is estimated for each voxel (see [1]). The pRF model used here is a 2D Gaussian; the free parameters are the Gaussian's x- and y-position, and its width (SD). This rather simple pRF model is best suited for early visual cortex (higher cortical areas may require more complex models).

### How to use - stimulus presentation

1. Installation

The stimulus presentation is implemented in [Psychopy](http://psychopy.org/), so if you would like to run the experiment, you first need to install Psychopy (if you already have fMRI data and would like to run the analysis, you can skip this step). On [debian](https://www.debian.org/), Psychopy can easily be installed using `apt-get`:

```bash
sudo apt-get install psychopy
```

If you're running some other operating system, please refer to the [Psychopy website](http://psychopy.org/).

For the stimulus presentation, you do not need to install `pyprf`. You only need a copy of the folder `~/pyprf/pyprf/stimulus_presentation`. The easiest way to get the `pyprf` stimuli is to clone the github repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ingo-m/pyprf.git
```
(Or click the download button.)

Then you can simply copy the folder `stimulus_presentation` and all its contents to the computer that you use for stimulus presentation. (Do not change the folder names. )

2. Create design matrix

Before you can run the experiment, you need to create a design matrix in which you specify the experimental design (e.g. how many repetitions of the stimulus, inter trial interval for target events, fMRI volume TR, etc.). You can either open the script `~/pyprf/pyprf/stimulus_presentation/code/create_design_matrix.py` in Psychopy and run it from there, or call it directly at command line.

You can specify all parameters in the GUI that will pop up. Note that there is one stimulus per fMRI volume, so you have to know the volume TR when creating the design matrix.

3. Stimulus presentation

In order to present the stimuli, you can open the file `~/pyprf/pyprf/stimulus_presentation/code/stimulus.py` in Psychopy and run it from there. Alternatively, you can call the presentation script directly from command line:

``` bash
python `~/pyprf/pyprf/stimulus_presentation/code/stimulus.py`
```

A GUI will open where you can specify further experimental parameters. Importantly, the name of the design matrix (e.g. 'Run_01') needs to match that of the file you created in the previous step.

After starting the script, it will wait for a trigger signal from the fMRI scanner (default: keyboard button `5`).

The stimuli look like this:

You can interrupt the presentation by pressing `e` and `x` at the same time.

### How to use - analysis

1. Install `numpy`. For instance:

```bash
pip install numpy
```
(Or, alternatively, if you're using conda, `conda install -c conda-forge numpy`.)

2. The `pyprf` package can directly be installed from PyPI, in the following way:

```bash
pip install pyprf
```

(Alternatively, you could also installed it from the repository, like this: `git clone https://github.com/ingo-m/pyprf.git` followed by `pip install /path/to/pyprf`.)

3. Data analysis:

In order to prepare the analysis, you need to run the stimulus presentation script in *logging mode* in order to create a log of the stimulus presentation. Run `~/pyprf/pyprf/stimulus_presentation/code/stimulus.py` (as described above, either from Psychopy or at command line). In the GUI, set 'Logging mode' to `True`.

The stimulus presentation log is created in the folder `~/pyprf/pyprf/stimulus_presentation/log/Run_*_frames/`.

The analysis parameters are set in a config file. An example file can be found [here](https://github.com/ingo-m/pyprf/blob/master/pyprf/analysis/config_default.csv). See comments therein for more information.

Run the analysis:
``` bash
pyprf -config /path/to/config.csv
```

### Dependencies

`pyprf` is implemented in [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/).

If you install `pyprf` using `pip` (as described above), all of the following dependencies except for `Psychopy` and `numpy` are installed automatically - you do not have to take care of this yourself. Simply follow the above installation instructions.

¹: For considerably faster performance

²: Can yield fast performance, depending on hardware. However, requires  tensorflow to be configured for GPU usage (additional tensorflow specific dependencies, including GPU drivers).

The analysis can be carried out in three different ways: using [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [cython](http://cython.org/), or [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). You can set this option in the `config.csv` file. All three approaches yield the same results, but differ in their dependencies and computational time:
- **Numpy** uses numpy for the model fitting. Should work out of the box.
- **Cython** offers a considerable speedup by using compiled cython code for model fitting. Should work out of the box. _This approach is recommended for most users_.
- **Tensorflow** may outperform the other options in terms of speed (depending on the available hardware) by running the GLM model fitting on the graphics processing unit (GPU). However, in order for this to work, tensorflow needs to be configured to use the GPU (including respective drivers). See the [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) website for information on how to configure your system to use the GPU. If you do not configure tensorflow to use the GPU, the analysis should still run without error on the CPU. Because this analysis may run single-threaded, it would be slow.
Numpy is always required, no matter which option you choose.

### Special Note for this fork
Conda environment highly recommended due to the dependency requirements.
Installation of Numpy=1.15.1 before installation of pyprf may cause errors. To fix this, simply install a numpy (compatible with the current environment) then the dependencies for pyprf analysis will be uninstalled and reinstalled automatically during `pip install pyprf`
